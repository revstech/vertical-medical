Known Issues / Roadmap
======================

* Uninstalling this app does not remove any of the bundled modules due to the
  way that Odoo manages this process. If necessary, they will need to be removed
  individually.

===========

Bugs are tracked on
`GitHub Issues <https://github.com/OCA/vertical-medical/issues>`_. In case of
trouble, please check there if your issue has already been reported. If you
