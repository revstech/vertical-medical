============================================
Prescription Verification - States and Logic
============================================

This module introduces the notion of verification to the prescription states 
added in `medical_prescription_state`, which can now be either verified or 
unverified. It also adds the following logic:

* Once a prescription order is in a verified state, it can be cancelled or 
  marked as an exception, but no other changes to the order are allowed
* When a prescription order moves from an unverified state to a verified one, 
  its order lines automatically move to a hold state
* When a prescription order is cancelled or marked as an exception, its order 
  lines are automatically marked as exceptions
* Once a prescription order line is in a verified state, it cannot be moved to 
  an unverified state other than the exception state
